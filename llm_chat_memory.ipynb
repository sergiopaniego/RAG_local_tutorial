To do this, you'll need to press F2 during boot-up (just after powering on). You'll then enter the BIOS setup menu, where you can reset the settings to their defaults and save the changes. This might help resolve any issues with the laptop's hardware or firmware.\\n\\nIf none of these steps work, it's possible that there's a more serious issue with your laptop's hardware or motherboard. In this case, I'd recommend contacting Dell support for further assistance, as they may be able to diagnose and repair the issue under warranty (if applicable).\\n\\nDoes any of this sound like something you'd like to try?\""

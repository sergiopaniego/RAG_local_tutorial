      "Question: What is the purpose of the course?\n",
      "Answer:  Based on the context provided, the purpose of the course appears to be to teach participants how to build machine learning systems that work in real-world scenarios. The course covers a wide range of topics, including best practices for tackling common challenges faced by machine learning engineers, how to use various techniques such as active learning and distributed training, and how to create pipelines using Amazon SageMaker and open-source tools. The course also includes live, interactive sessions where participants can ask questions and interact with the instructor and other students in real time. Additionally, the course provides lifetime access to every past and future cohort, allowing participants to learn at their own pace and benefit from updates to the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How many hours of live sessions?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the context provided, the answer to the question \"How many hours of live sessions?\" is:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Every iteration of the program gives you 18 hours of hands-on, live training spread over 3 weeks.\n",
      "* Live sessions will take place every Monday and Thursday at the same time. On Wednesdays, we'll host office hours when you can bring your questions, projects, or anything else you want to discuss.\n",
      "* The program includes a total of 18 hours of live training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How many coding assignments are there in the program?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, it seems that the answer to the question \"How many coding assignments are there in the program?\" is not explicitly mentioned. However, from the context, it can be inferred that there are coding walkthroughs and live sessions where students will work on coding assignments. The instructor mentions that there are 18 hours of hands-on, live training spread over 3 weeks, and that every session is recorded, allowing students to attend live or watch the recording later. This suggests that there are multiple coding assignments throughout the program. However, without further clarification from the source text, it's difficult to provide a precise answer to this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Is there a program certificate upon completion?\n",
      "Answer: Yes, according to the document, there is a program certificate upon completion of the course. The certificate is mentioned in the following passage:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past, present, and future cohort. Every new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many students take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates. The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program when life gets in the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests that upon completion of the course, participants will receive a program certificate as a recognition of their accomplishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What programming language will be used in the program?\n",
      "Answer: The answer to your question can be found on the fourth page of the PDF document:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have experience writing code. We'll use Python throughout the class, but you won't have any problems if you know any other language.\"\n",

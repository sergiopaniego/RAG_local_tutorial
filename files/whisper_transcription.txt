 Hi, my name is Kevin Fowler and I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to work in public science. I'm very fortunate to have been able to be trained by excellent mentors early in my career to give me a toolbox to be able to unravel important questions that can help us better understand our physical universe. I'm really excited about the opportunity to participate in the science that works around agriculture and find out ways that we can farm more sustainably, working in ways that we can help limit environmental impacts of farming, but also providing profitable ways for farmers to stay in business. We're really excited about the technologies that we create creating better foods for the American consumer and industrialized world consumer, but also getting to people in need so that they can have more selection of better fruits and vegetables. Going forward, I think that the future will depend upon the integration of all technologies at the table and it's really important that we pay attention to this new breakthroughs and integrate them into our agricultural schemes. The future of agriculture in medicine room really relies on us being open to all new solutions and using all of them to solve our problems to have better planet and better people.
